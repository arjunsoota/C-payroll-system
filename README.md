# C++ Payroll System
This project was done under the guidance of my mentor Mrs. Niti Arora without whose help this project wouldn't have been possible.
## My class XII CBSE C++ project <br><br>
__Description__ :
1. This software can used to process the salary for the employees on monthly or yearly basis.
2. First of all master code of each employee is to be created with basic data like name, father’s name, designation etc.
3. A binary master file is created which maintains data like :
• Basic salary and Net salary
• HRA rate
• DA rate
• PF rate
• Tax
4. Basis the above input system will then calculate the gross and net salary for an employee using following formula:
Gross salary = Basic +HRA +DA
Net salary = Gross – PF–Tax
5. The system also provides functions to input the attendance records of employees.
6. Salary slip is then generated gathering data from both master file and attendance record file.
